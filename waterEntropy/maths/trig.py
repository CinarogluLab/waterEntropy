    Scanning every heavy atom for each query dominates the water stage: ~2,200

    evaluations. One grid search per frame answers all of them at once, in CSR
    form (``starts`` offsets into a neighbour array ordered by query atom).

    A shortlist is only valid for the exact inputs it was built from, so the
    cache is keyed on the positions *and* the periodic box: the same coordinates
    under a different box have different periodic neighbours, and reusing the
    old shortlist would silently miss some. Nothing in waterEntropy mutates
    positions or the box mid-frame today; the guard is here so that correctness
    does not depend on that staying true. The check is a contiguous comparison,
    far cheaper than the per-query scan it replaces.

    box), leaving callers on the original full-scan path.
